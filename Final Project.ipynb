    "### INTRO AND BACKGROUND\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "Discussed known information on movie success based on certain variables and isolated social media presence to be left out in many predictions. Located dataset of movies with social media measurement and cleaned extraneous information outside the scope of interest. Performed comparison of distributions and normality tests followed by regression models. Afterwards, concluded that social media presence is a poor indicator for a movie’s gross income\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research Question\n",
    "Which is a better predictor of a movie’s gross income, the actors’ or the director’s FB likes?\n",
    "*Note: We generalize popularity to FB likes due to the nature of social media being used to promote certain individuals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background and Prior Work \n",
    "Since Barry Litman’s initial study of financial film success in 1983, multiple newer studies have tried to make more multiple regression models to find new or confirm old determinants of box office success. In their models, they compared revenue, as a dependent variable, to possible determinants of profitability as the independent variables. The overall evidence between multiple studies’ variables that have consistently shown to be significantly and positively correlated to revenue have been production cost, the assistance of a major distributor, academy award nominations, and sequels with the strongest relationship being production budget. Other possible factors such as critic reviews, time of release, advertising and specific genres are less certain since the correlational findings across different studies show contradictory results. Additionally, there have been other studies that have analyzed stock markets and simulations to look at the specific relationship between star power and box office performance, however these studies’ findings contradict each other, leading us to conclude that there are no conclusive findings yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our interest in this topic stems from the possibility of there being another possible measurement of star power and the effects it may have on the financial success of movies: social media. Social media has played a growing part in how society keeps up to date on what’s happening in pop culture. This project will use Facebook likes as a measurement of the attention a star or director garners from the public and correlate these values to see if these parts of the creative sphere affect the box office.\n",

    "We believe that an actor’s popularity will be a stronger predictor of a movie’s gross income while the popularity of a director will be a stronger predictor of a movie’s rating. From this, a model can be made to predict a movie’s income based on the popularity of a director and actors\n"

    "#### Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing\n",
    "When parsing through the IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset, we were only concerned with columns that were useful in identifying the movies, gross, cast, directors, and the Facebook likes connected to each entry. While cleaning our dataset, we wanted to focus our scope on US movies, so we dropped entries of movies that weren’t from the US and weren’t in English. Afterwards, we dropped columns that were unnecessary to our analysis of movie revenue and actor/director likes. We wanted to keep the genre column to consider the potential effect it may have along with the Facebook likes on the gross. We also dropped duplicates so they don't give us an illusion of how many distinct movie titles we actually have. Following that we discovered that there were duplicate titles that didn't match on every entry in the cell. Further investigation lead us to find that these duplicates differ on actor likes by around 1. We therefore decide to manually drop the 8 rows that have duplicate titles due to similar discrepencies in entered data. We then add a column for each genre that exists in the dataframe to assist us in our prediction of genre's effect with Facebook likes on the movie gross. Finally, as we decide to log transform the data to get a graph closer to a normal curve, we realize that some actor and director Facebook likes are 0, so we shift all the Facebook likes by 0.1."

It's also important to note the outliers that exist beyond the clumped areas in the 0-3 range along the x axis. Because of these outliers, the positive correlation here may be even weaker than depicted."

Even after the log transformation, the scatter plot still has four distinct groups above -1, 0-3, 3-4, and >4. It's also important to note that the bulk of the height for the biggest group (in range 0-3) peaks at around 2 million dollars while the bulk of the pillar above -1 peaks around 4 million dollars. This uneven distribution caused by the large amounts of directors who previously were observed to have 0 FB likes (more than any other category) is the likely reason that the regression line currently shows that there is little to no correlation."

    "### Ethics and Privacy Considerations\n",
    "The dataset has some issues of certain facebook likes where certain actors and directors have incorrect listings. For example, the director Spike Lee within the dataset had a listing of 0 facebook likes. However, future observation displayed an official facebook page with 765,000 likes. In addition, we observed duplicate indexed movies in the data set that have inconsistent entries in cast likes as well as number voted users. Although our observation of the data does not include this column, the fact that there are inconsistencies in the first place leads to some doubts about the dataset as a whole. As a result, this potentiates the issue of false data which would give way to incorrect predictions and assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regards to the method in which the data was collected, we do not know for sure as the dataset does not explain their process in cataloging information. However, we have reason to believe that privacy is not infringed upon as most of the information that we will focus on is made public on either IMDb and Facebook. Since we are focusing on Facebook likes, we believe that the potential privacy issues is relatively low as they are metrics generated anonymously. The dataset is also made public on kaggle, a dataset sharing website. "

    "### Conclusion & Discussion\n",
    "From observing the regression models, each prediction instance has a low p-value meaning there is a significance to their inclusion in the model. However, the model itself accounts for very little variation demonstrated by the low r-squared. This is mostly explained due to the bimodal distribution of actor and director likes which causes a strict model to form. From this, we conclude that models generated from actor and director Facebook likes serve as poor indicators for a movie’s gross income. Therefore, we reject our hypothesis and posit that there is no correlation of FB likes of actors and directors to a movie’s gross income which is further identified in the low r-values in our scatterplots. In addition, there are confounding variables that influence both likes and gross income such as advertisement or the movie’s release date. Advertisement can bring consumers to movies as well as interest in the actors in the movie. A movie’s release date changes the rate in which consumers are likely to watch movies such as during vacation breaks. These confounding variables could have contributed in the distribution of likes as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had any further resources and time to continue this project, we would have liked other measurements to observe social media presence such as Instagram and Twitter. To coincide the need for better dataset information, we would like the dataset to be updated to relieve rounding as well as inconsistencies. For future use, updates to new releases since the original posting would allow for further observations.\n"
